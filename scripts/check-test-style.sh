# select_test_files prints every test file this gate is allowed to judge, one per
# line, relative to the repository root.
#
# The scanner is never handed a directory to walk. `teststyle -root .` walks the
# filesystem and prunes by directory *name* only (.git, vendor, node_modules,
# testdata), and the root of a linked git worktree is an ordinary directory whose
# `.git` is a regular *file* holding a `gitdir:` pointer -- nothing prunes it. The
# walk therefore descended into every checkout parked under the repo and reported
# its tests as violations of this repo's baseline, so the gate was red for code
# that is not in the working tree at all, and `-write-baseline` captured those
# foreign paths into the tracked baseline.
#
# git is the authority on what belongs to this checkout: it refuses to descend
# past a nested `.git` marker, so no worktree path can appear here regardless of
# ignore rules. This mirrors the testify check below, which searches tracked
# files only for the same reason.
#
#   --cached                    tracked files
#   --others --exclude-standard brand-new local test files, so the gate still
#                               fires before `git add`. Dropping these would make
#                               the gate green on the very file the author is
#                               about to commit.
#   core.quotePath=false        emit non-ASCII paths raw instead of C-quoted, so
#                               they survive the line-based read below
#
# A future submodule would appear here as a gitlink rather than as its files; it
# would need a scan of its own.
# third_party/ is excluded: those files are vendored from ariga/atlas and
# PROVENANCE.md states none of them is modified here, so their style is not this
# repository's to hold.

# tell a call from a sentence -- `\b(assert|require)\.` is "a word, then a full
# stop" -- and `\b`
# meant "word boundary" to the regex engine git grep compiles with on Linux and
# the literal letter `b` to the one it compiles with on macOS, so the same tree
# was refused on CI for a comment and accepted locally for a real call. See
# stokaro/ptah#1139. depguard matches the import declaration, which is a call
# site by construction and has no regex flavor to vary.
